Hello, I'm an international student in MC208-Master of IT. This is reference to my query ref. SE3504503
I accidentally enrolled COSC2648 Postgraduate Information Technology Project to semester 2 2021, I intended to enroll in Sem1 as overload. I have had permission granted to do this 
by my course coordinator.
Can you kindly help me do so as my classes have already started, and I would like to enrol as soon as possible before deadline to add classes.




 I tried to enrol into a course "Postgraduate project", but it displayed as overload in enrolment online.
In my last email to rmit connect I was advised to contact my course coordinator and get back to you. 
I emailed my course coordinator regarding overload of a course as I am in my final semester. I have received an approval
can you kindly guide me how to go ahead from here ?
